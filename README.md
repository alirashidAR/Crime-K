# Shield: Empowering Women's Safety with Data-Driven Community Support

## Overview
Shield is an AI-driven initiative aimed at enhancing women's safety within communities using data-driven technologies. It leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms to create a safer environment for women by identifying crime hotspots and providing community support.

## Objectives
- **Crime Hotspot Visualization**: Utilizing K-Means clustering to identify and visualize crime hotspots within a community.
- **Hotspot Radius Calculation**: Effectively calculating hotspot radii to demarcate areas susceptible to crime, allowing proactive safety measures.

## Model Components
- **Scikit-learn**: Employed for crime hotspot identification and K-Means clustering.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and plotting crime hotspot distributions.

## Functionalities
1. **Engineered Crime Hotspot Visualization**: The model visualizes crime hotspots by clustering crime data, allowing stakeholders to identify areas with high crime occurrences.
2. **Hotspot Radius Calculation**: Based on clustered data, the model computes the radius of crime hotspots, aiding in defining the boundaries of vulnerable areas.
3. **Serialized Models for Identification and Radius Calculation**: Serialized ML models are developed for both hotspot identification and radius calculation, enhancing scalability and ease of use.

## Impact
The Shield model contributes to community safety by empowering stakeholders with actionable insights into crime-prone areas. Its accurate hotspot identification and radius calculation facilitate targeted safety measures and community support initiatives.

## Future Enhancements
Future iterations of the Shield project aim to:
- Enhance real-time data ingestion for dynamic crime analysis.
- Implement predictive analytics for proactive safety measures.
- Integrate community engagement functionalities for a more comprehensive support system.
